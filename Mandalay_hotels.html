	<h2>Travel Tips</h2>
	<p>I suggest you to bring cotton clothes as the weather in Mandalay is extremely hot in summer but if you are traveling in winter, I recommend you to bring some warm sweaters, coats and jackets as it’s extremely cold at night in winter. You should also bring some sun-cream. You can also try Burmese Tanakh which is 3 in 1: sun-protection, makeup and a cooling sensation instead of sun-cream.
It usually takes about three to five days to travel around the Mandalay city including all many famous places, pagodas, temples and doing activities.
