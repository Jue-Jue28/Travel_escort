	<h2>Travel Tips</h2>
	<p>I recommend you to bring sweaters, coats and some warm clothes as well as cotton clothes because the weather in Pyin Oo Lwin is quite hot during the day but cold at night. As the Myanmar weather is hot, wear sunglasses or hat for sun-protection. To visit and explore all kinds of tourist’s attractions, it lasts at least for a week.</p>
