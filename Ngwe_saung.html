	<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">When you think of visiting Myanmar, beach resorts may not be the first thing that comes to mind. However, if you are looking for some rest and relaxation at the end of a trip full of adventures and exploration, look no further than Ngwe Saung. Located 48 km west of Pathein, this beach resort is a five-hour drive from the city of Yangon. This quiet fishing village now has many hotels along the beautiful seafront which makes it accessible for travelers. If you’re heading to Ngwe Saung, read on for my top tips on where to stay and what to do! </p>
	<h2>Things to do in Ngwe Saung</h2>
		<h3>Visit the beach</h3>
		<p>Of course, the main attraction here is the beach! The beach stretches for many kilometers and offers beautiful white sand. Towards the north end of the beach is the village of Ngwe Saung. This is a lovely area to visit at night and there are many seafood restaurants and shops selling local souvenirs and gifts. Depending on where you are staying, it can take up to an hour to walk along the beach from the southern resorts to the village. I’d highly recommend taking the walk at sunset, to enjoy the beautiful views over the Bay of Bengal. This was one of the highlights of my time here! If you don’t fancy walking back to your hotel afterwards, you can get a motorbike taxi, or you may even want to hire your own motorbike.</p>
		<h3>Relax on the Beach</h3>
		<p>First thing’s first: take some time to relax on the beach. Bury your feet in the soft, white sand, take a dip in the ocean, and catch up on that novel you’ve been meaning to read. This is an amazing place to soak up some sun and spend the day lounging around. Plus, since it’s a quieter place, you should be able to find a spot to have all to yourself! Just keep in mind that the ocean currents can be quite strong and there aren’t any lifeguards on duty, so swim at your own risk.</p>
		<h3>Go snorkeling</h3>

		<p>There is a small island located towards the south of Ngwe Saung, which you can visit on foot when the tide is out. You can enjoy the view of the beach from here and seeing the ocean around us from the top of the island. This is also a really popular area for snorkeling and boasts both amazing corals and fish. There are a few other islands located a couple of miles from the shore, and these offer fantastic swimming opportunities. You can take a boat trip with a guide to snorkel in the crystal waters.</p>
		<h3>Explore by motorbike</h3>
		<p>Hiring a motorbike is a great idea if you want to explore the whole area of Ngwe Saung. There is a tarmac road that runs parallel to the beach, which you can drive down if you like. If you have a bike, consider heading even further south than the main resort area. Here you’ll find the beach is even quieter, and when you reach the isolated fishing village, you can enjoy a beer at the beachfront refreshment point. </p>
		<h3>Try some water sports</h3>
		<p>For water sports fans, the best place to rent equipment is the Ngwe Saung Yacht Club Water Sports(I really recommend to try even though I haven’t reached there yet), located in front of the Yacht Club & Resort. This is the only place you’ll be able to rent surfboards, boogie boards and skim boards. The surf here is not the best, but around dawn, the waves start to break a little more.</p>
		<h3>Take a Trip to Lovers Island </h3>
		<center>

		</center>
		<p>For some unreal sunset views or just to stretch your legs after a long day of relaxing, make your way over to nearby Lovers Island for a little taste of nature during your beach stay. Lovers Island is right next to Ngwe Saung Beach and is accessible by boat or foot. You’re easily able to hire a speedboat for the quick trip over, or if you’re feeling extra adventurous and the tide is low enough, gander over through the water. Just be sure to watch out for the sharp rocks as you approach the island. As this is a popular spot, you’ll likely encounter many others trying to snap photos of the landscape. But it’s still worth the walk to the top to view a panorama of beach, ocean, and other nearby surroundings. </p>
		<h3>Wonderful scenery on the beach</h3>
		<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">Not too far from Lover’s Island is a stamping-ground of local tourism – Ngwe Saung beach that has the length of 15 kilometers with the stretch of white sand sparkling beneath the sun. After traversing a shallow stream swarmed with algae, the beach is in front of you where you will see beachgoers who wear varied kinds of fashion from speedos (swimwear brand of Australia) to burqas (an enveloping outer garment worn by women in some Islamic traditions) to longyis (a sheet of cloth widely worn in Burma) sitting under the big umbrellas. Young men laze away their time with four-wheelers fashion juice boxes and coconuts while older men decorate their horses with traditional fabrics and wait for their performance in “horse-back riding on the beach at sunset” fantasies.</p>
