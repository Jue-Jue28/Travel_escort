	<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">Bagan is an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar. From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom, the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, more than 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2200 temples and pagodas survive.
From 1044 to 1287, Bagan was the capital as well as the political, economic and cultural nerve center of the Pagan Empire. Over the course of 250 years, Bagan's rulers and their wealthy subjects constructed over 10,000 religious’ monuments (approximately 1000 stupas, 10,000 small temples and 3000 monasteries) in an area of 104 square kilometers (40 sq mi) in the Bagan plains.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
	<p>Bagan stands out for not only the sheer number of religious edifices of Myanmar but also the magnificent architecture of the buildings, and their contribution to Burmese temple design. The artistry of the architecture of pagodas in Bagan proves the achievement of Myanmar craftsmen in handicrafts. The Bagan temple falls into one of two broad categories: the stupa-style solid temple and the gu-style hollow temple.</p>
	<h3>Stupas</h3>
	<p>A stupa, also called a pagoda or chedi, is a massive structure, typically with a relic chamber inside</p>
	<h3>Hollow Temples</h3>
	<p>In contrast to the stupas, the hollow gu-style temple is a structure used for meditation, devotional worship of the Buddha and other Buddhist rituals.</p>
