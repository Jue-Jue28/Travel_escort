	<h2>Places to go in Taunggyi</h2>
		<h3>Inle Lake</h3>
		<img src="inle.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p>Inle Lake, a freshwater lake located in the Nyaungshwe Township of Shan State, part of Shan Hills in Myanmar. It is the second largest lake in Myanmar with an estimated surface area of 44.9 square miles, and one of the highest at an elevation of 2,900 feet. During the dry season, the average water depth is 7 feet, with the deepest point being 12 feet. During the rainy season, this can increase by 5 feet.

		<p>Shwe Yaunghwe Kyaung Monastery is a beautiful wooden monastery near Inle Lake in Myanmar. It is located about one kilometer from the town of Nyaungshwe, on the way from Pindaya Caves to Inle Lake</p>
		<h3>Oriental Ballooning - Inle Lake</h3>
		<img src="ballooning.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p>Nestled between the mountains of the southern Shan State lies one of Myanmar's top destinations, spectacular Inle Lake, in the Southern Shan Hills, with the scenery providing stunning panoramic views. Flying over stilted villages, leg-rowing fishermen, floating gardens and layered mountains as a backdrop, Inle Lake is probably the most extraordinary place in the world to fly in a hot air balloon.</p>
		<h3>Nyaung Shwe Cultural Museum</h3>
		<img src="nyaung.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p>This equal parts imposing and melancholy structure is the former haw (palace) of the last saopha (sky prince) of Nyaungshwe, Sao Shwe Thaike, who also served as the first president of independent Burma. Today, the mostly empty building holds a few dusty displays and is worth visiting more for the stately brick-and-teak structure than for any information on Shan culture or history.</p>
		<h3>Htet Eain Cave Temple</h3>
		<img src="htet.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">Htat Eian Cave Temple. The cave is less than 4 km away from Nyaungshwe. It is a nice “out of the way” spot to visit.</p>
