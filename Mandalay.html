	<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">Mandalay is the second largest city in Myanmar and it’s one of the ancient and spectacular towns where our last one and only precious royal palace as well as many pagodas and famous places exist. It’s located on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River and has a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census). Nowadays, it’s the economic center of Upper Myanmar and can even be considered the center of Burmese culture. A continuing influx of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Yunnan, since the late 20th century, has reshaped the city's ethnic makeup and increased commerce with China. Besides, Mandalay remains Upper Burma's main commercial, educational and health center as well.
    <br>As the royal capital city of Myanmar, Mandalay is full of old traditional cultures and histories, there are many historical places that you should definitely visit when you tour in Mandalay. So, now I’m going to recommend 5 famous places to travel around in Mandalay.</p>
	<h2>Places to go in Mandalay</h2>
		<h3> The Mahamuni Buddha Temple</h3>
		<img src="mahamuni.png" style="width: 270px; height: 390px;">
		<p>The Mahamuni Buddha Temple, also called the Mahamuni Image) is a Buddhist temple and major pilgrimage site, which is located southwest of Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma). There is a big Mahamuni Buddha image inside the temple that is originally brought by Arakan. Some believe that it’s one of the likenesses of Buddha which made at the time of Budda alive.Although it’s crowded every time, it’s one of the places you must visit in Mandalay as you can explore the masterpieces and architectures of old Burmese. The best way is to take a taxi if you stay at a hotel that costs about $5 for foreigners. If you are an early bird, you can see the daily formal face washing rituals in the early morning about 4 am or 4:30 am. You can offer flowers, food to Buddha and donate money for the refurbishment of the whole temple.
        <br>Note: Only men are allowed to offer flowers and food as a Burmese culture. Visitors are not also allowed to wear shoes around the temple area. Women are forbidden to wear short skirts and shorts.
        </p>
		<h3> Mandalay Palace</h3>
		<img src="palace.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p>Mandalay palace is the last royal palace of the last kingdom of Myanmar, Konbaung Dynasty which was constructed between 1857 and 1859 as part of King Mindon's founding of the new royal capital city of Mandalay. Many places of the complex were destroyed during World War II by the bomb attack but it was rebuilt at the start of the 1990s with some modern materials. Nowadays, it has become the spirit of Mandalay and a tourist attraction. Most of the places are controlled by the military for security reasons, but the main royal mint is open from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm. Inside the palace, you can see many statues of the Queen and King as well as gorgeous and spectacular architecture of Burmese last Kingdom. The admission is only US$1 which is very reasonable.
        <br>Note: You’re allowed to take photos.
        </p>
		<h3> Mandalay Hill</h3>
		<img src="hill.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p>Mandalay hill is a 240 meters (790 ft) hill that is located to the northeast of the city center of Mandalay in Myanmar. It is known for its abundance of pagodas and monasteries, and has been a major pilgrimage site for Burmese Buddhists. There is a stairway that will reach the summit of Mandalay, which is 120 meters above sea level and it normally takes about 45 minutes. For those who are fit to make the climb, it is considered a rewarding experience and a meritorious deed at the same time. Along the way, you can see and explore several temples and pagodas. Once you reach the top of the mountain, you can sightsee the attractive panoramic view of Mandalay city and the worthy sunset or sunrise over the hill. If you don’t want to walk, you can also take a bus which will take about 15 minutes. Admission is free for all; you can visit there at any time. There are many restaurants at the bottom of the mountain, you can have your meal at the same time after you’ve climbed.

		<h3> U Bein Bridge</h3>

		<p>You should definitely go to U Bein Bridge whenever you visit Mandalay. It’s a crossing that spans the Taungthaman Lake near Amarapura in Myanmar. The 1.2-kilometre (0.75 mi) bridge was built around 1850 and recognized as the oldest and longest teakwood bridge in the world. The bridge becomes the highlight of Mandalay tour to enjoy unforgettable sunset and sunrise for the travelers as well as to take awesome photographs. If you don’t fancy walking across, we recommend the travelers to take a boat and drive underneath the bridge to feel the full experience of a picturesque wooden structure from a completely different angle. Watching the sunset will offer a feeling of languorous and viewing the sunrise will release the stress. You can also ride a bike and feel calm and cozy weather there if you’re interested.

		<h3> Jade Market</h3>
		<img src="Jade.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">Now, the last place that I recommend is “Jake Market” which is located at the 87st Mandalay. There you can buy many Jade products like necklaces, bracelets, earrings and many other jewelries. You can also explore how jade is being crafted and can watch the artisans at work as they grind, clean and polish the intricate pieces of elegant jade. The market is busy and crowded but it’s worth it to see lots of jade in one exact place. You can take pictures of the process of making crafts but show them respect and interest. The entrance fee for this market alone is 2,500 MMK, so it is worth it. It is open every day except for Full Moon Day of every month. There are thousands of colorful, expensive, reasonable jades which are very gorgeous and crystal so I highly recommend you to go there.
        <br>Note: Please be careful to wear scandals (or) slippers and make sure to cover your knee and shoulders, especially for women because of its restriction when you visit around Mandalay and pilgrimage area.</p>
