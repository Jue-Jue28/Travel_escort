	<h2>Travel Tips</h2>
	<p>Because Bagan is so hot, you'll want to wear light, airy and breathable clothes. You'll also want to keep in mind that entering the largest temples will require covering shoulders and usually covering legs (both men and women). youâ€™re going to have to take off your shoes for all of the temples you visit. If you are visiting during the cooler months (December and January), take a thin jacket with you. It gets cold at night.</p>
