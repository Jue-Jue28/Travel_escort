	<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">Pyin Oo Lwin, formerly and colloquially referred to as “Maymyo” is a scenic hill town in the Mandalay Region, Myanmar. It’s famous for its colorful and blossomy gardens and other significant places. It had a population of around 255,000 in 2014 and is one of the tourist attractions. It used to be a summer retreat during British rule, its altitude of 1,070m and relatively cool climate allowing the British ruling class to escape the fearsome heat of Mandalay and lower Myanmar. Although now blighted by more recent building developments, Pyin Oo Lwin’s colonial legacy still holds the key to the town’s charm and the surrounding area offers plenty to explore, including a number of magnificent waterfalls.</p>
	<h2>Places to go in Pyin Oo Lwin</h2>
		<h3> Mahar Ant Htoo Kan Thar</h3>
		<img src="Mahar.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p>It all starts from its history. The reason was that three marble Buddha Images sculpted in Mandalay were being transported to their planned destination in China. On this journey, one of the Buddha statues fell down from the truck and could not be reloaded due to its weight. After many attempts, this Image was left behind and the other two were taken on their way. A local Buddhist monk decided he would try faith. He sat for 7 days on this image and preached to the locals and recited teachings of Buddha. After 7 days the image was apparently easily lifted and placed in its current location and the local people built a pagoda as an offering to Buddha. Many visitors come and offer flowers, water, food and fruits to Buddha image as the good merits. Nowadays, it’s crowded every time and gets attention from many travelers.

		<h3>Kan Daw Gyi Botanical Garden</h3>

		<p>The National Kandawgyi Gardens, also known as National Botanical Gardens, is located in the Alpine town about 1.5 km south of Pyin Oo Lwin. It was first founded by Alex Roger who is forest research officer with the aid of Lady Cuffe in 1915. It was modelled after the Kew Gardens of England. The original area of the Botanical Garden was 240 acres (170 acres of land and 70 acres of water). The government declared it as a state-recognized garden in 1917 but in 1924, the site was declared as a Government Forest Reserve. The garden has many collections of flora, including foreign species, orchids of various species in orchid gardens, dahlia gardens, rose gardens, many exotic fruits and shady trees. The garden was upgraded to be a recreation garden in 2000 and renamed it “Kandawgyi National Gardens''. There is usually a “Flower Festival” in December with perfect cool weather which you must take part in and enjoy!</p>
		<h3>National Landmark Garden</h3>

		<p>Just beside the Kandawgyi National Botanical Gardens is another must-see attraction which is called “the National Landmarks Garden”. It consists of scale models of well-known landmarks from each State in Myanmar, including its most famous pagodas, spread over 50 acres of parkland. It was established in 2006 with the aim to be able to observe ancient cultural edifices, pagodas and stupas, palaces, caves, hills and mountains can be viewed round collectively in the garden. It opens 8 am to 6 pm everyday but time may differ on occasion days. There is also an amusement park just to the north: one ticket includes admission to both sites.</p>
		<h3>Pwe Kaut Waterfall</h3>
		<img src="Pwe.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p>The Pwe Kauk Falls is a very pleasant picnic spot in Pyin Oo Lwin where many Myanmar families come for a picnic. Pwe Kauk or B.E waterfalls is also known as Hampshire Falls in British times. It is located on the way to Lashio and not too far from Pyin Oo Lwin town. There are two waterfalls in Pwe Kauk where many people swim or play in the shallow waters. There is a market beside waterfalls where you can buy local products and souvenirs such as wines, strawberry jams, fruits and flowers etc. Pwe Kauk is stunned by its natural beauty and breathtaking scenery. It’s the best place to spend time with your family by swimming or playing in a mini background or picnic. So, I recommend you to go there with your family.

		<h3>Pate Chin Myaung Cave</h3>
		<img src="pate.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;">
		<p style="border-bottom: 2px dotted black; padding-bottom: 10px;">Peik Chin Myaung Cave (also known as Maha Nandamu Cave) is located on the Lashio road near Wetwang village, 12 miles east of Pyin Oo Lwin town. It is a limestone cave estimated between 230 million and 310 million years old. The cave is called Peik Chin Myaung as plenty of Peik Chin plants used to grow there. The entrance of the Peik Chin Myaung cave is about 20 ft wide and 1,600 ft long. The long cave is filled with so many Buddha images and pagodas in various sizes and positions at all corners and niches. There is also a mini waterfall in front of the entrance of the cave. It’s crowded during the day time so I suggest you go early in the morning about 6:30 am. There are also small stalls near the cave so you can have them as snacks.
