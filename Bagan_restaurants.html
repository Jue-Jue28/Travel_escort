		<h2>About this resturant</h2>
		<p>The Nanda restaurant is one of the best in Bagan which is given 4 out of 5 rating in google reviews. The restaurant specializes in Asian and Burmese cuisine. Food prices are a bit expensive but worth it. It’s worth it because not only is the food is good but it also includes a puppet show while eating. By visiting this restaurant, you can enjoy not only Burmese food but also watch puppet show which is one of the cultural heritages of Myanmar. There is also a puppet shop next to the restaurant, so you can also buy puppets to take home. Therefore, if you’re visiting Bagan, you should definitely visit this restaurant.

		<h2>About this resturant</h2>
		<p>If you are an adventurous kind of person, I am sure you would love this place. When we booked we were not sure we had made the right decision. For sure a hotel would be a much more comfortable option. The staff was super nice and flexible with us, always willing to help. They prepared mohinga for breakfast because we hadn't had the chance to try it yet. Also, we enjoyed a delicious local dinner there, much better than in many restaurants. In addition, living few days in one of the bamboo houses was an unforgettable experience.</p>
